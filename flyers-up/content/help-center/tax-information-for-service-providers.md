## Tax Information for Service Providers (Education Only)

This page provides general information about U.S. tax reporting concepts that may apply to service providers on Flyers Up. **This is not tax advice.** If you have questions about your situation, consider consulting a qualified tax professional.

### What is a W‑9?
A **W‑9** is an IRS form used to provide your taxpayer information for U.S. tax reporting. Businesses may request a W‑9 so they can report certain payments to the IRS.

### What is a 1099‑NEC?
A **1099‑NEC** is a tax form used to report **nonemployee compensation** (payments made to independent contractors) in the U.S. If you meet applicable thresholds under U.S. tax rules, you may receive a 1099‑NEC for a given tax year.

### What does Flyers Up store?
To support payout compliance and tax reporting workflows, Flyers Up may store:
- The **type** of tax identification number you use for U.S. tax reporting (for example, SSN or ITIN)
- A **status** for tax form completion/verification (for example, not started, pending, verified, or action required)
- Your **Stripe Connect** account reference for payouts

**We do not store your tax identification number value (e.g., your SSN/ITIN) in our database.**

### If you need help
- If your tax form status shows **Action required**, follow the instructions shown in the app (or contact support).
- If you are unsure which tax forms apply to you, consider speaking with a tax professional.
